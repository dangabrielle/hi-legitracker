# Hawaii State Legislation Tracker
The Hawaii State Legislation Tracker is a web-based application that tracks state-level legislative bills in Hawaii. It allows users to search, filter, and view Hawai ªi state legislature bills related to economics, task force, and the University of Hawaii Economics Research Organization (UHERO).

This project was developed to help economists at UHERO to monitor and respond proactively to state legislation that could impact operations. As UHERO often contracts with the state, certain proposed bills may affect the availability or structure of that work. By using this tool, we can engage early in the legislative process to advocate for or against specific measures.
